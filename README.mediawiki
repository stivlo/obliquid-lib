obliquid-lib are Java classes that I use for my daily development and not bound
to any specific application. This collection is released with LGPL3 licence.
They are my personal code library that I've used in multiple projects.
All classes are not meant to be comprehensive, but they contain what I need,
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_ain%27t_gonna_need_it YAGNI] style.
